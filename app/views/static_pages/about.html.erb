      <h1>Where to bike</h1>
      <p>
        Oakland is considered a great place to ride bikes—it has temperate weather, flat streets, hills and a diverse array of scenery. After Oakland North did a story on 10 great walks in Oakland, we thought a story on five great bike rides in Oakland would be helpful, too.

      <h1>Why us</h1>
      <p>
        Another reason why it pays to shop local is that your LBS will often give you a discount on any maintenance or accessories that you buy from the shop, if you originally bought your bike from the LBS. A local bike store relies on loyal customers, and they are oftentimes willing to reward you for your continued business. A local bike shop will be familiar with you and your bike, and they can recommend components and equipment that will keep you safe when you are on the road.
